### Hey all! My name is Dennis ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a Solutions Arhitect with Red Hat.
* I really enjoy diving into technology and learning how to best use it.
* I'm a huge advocate for automation.
* I'm also guilty of spending 5 hours scripting something that takes 10 minutes to do manually.
* Please feel free to reach out and say hello!
